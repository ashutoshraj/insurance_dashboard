## Project Description
Health insurance costs are on the rise every year. Insurance premiums keep on increasing and medical bills have 
become more complicated over time. We have undertaken a project to study the cost billed by health insurance 
companies for more than 1300 data points and perform both predictive and descriptive statistical analysis using 
various data mining techniques. We aim to predict the health insurance cost that is likely to be incurred by a 
person with a certain set of predictors. At the same time our objective is to determine the predictors which 
affect health insurance cost of an individual the most, by studying the relationship between the health insurance 
cost and various predictors as well as by investigating the correlation among the predictors.
