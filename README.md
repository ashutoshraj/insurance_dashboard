## Project Description
Health insurance costs are on the rise every year. Insurance premiums keep on increasing and medical bills have 
become more complicated over time. We have undertaken a project to study the cost billed by health insurance 
companies for more than 1300 data points and perform both predictive and descriptive statistical analysis using 
various data mining techniques. We aim to predict the health insurance cost that is likely to be incurred by a 
person with a certain set of predictors. At the same time our objective is to determine the predictors which 
affect health insurance cost of an individual the most, by studying the relationship between the health insurance 
cost and various predictors as well as by investigating the correlation among the predictors.
## Source Data
The data used in this project is publicly available in the online portal Kaggle. The data can be accessed using the

The meta data information is as given below:
## Columns Description Type

- age: age of primary beneficiary

- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

- smoker: Smoking

- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Objectives 
### Our project aims to address certain key questions related to healthcare costs based on the available data.
- How can we relate health insurance cost to various predictors like age, sex, BMI, number of covered 
children, region of US? 
- Which variables have the most pronounced impact on health insurance cost? What are the variables 
with the least impact?
- How does medical cost depend on the predictors or a combination of several predictors? For example
  - Does a specific region in US show a greater health insurance cost compared to other regions?
  - How does health insurance cost for a smoker with low BMI compare to that of a non-smoker 
with high BMI?
  - How does the health insurance cost of a non-smoker old person compare to that of a smoker 
who is young?
  - How does number of covered children impact health insurance cost?
  - How does the health insurance cost males compare to that of females?
- What is the predicted health insurance cost for an individual in the US based on some basic 
demographic characteristics?
